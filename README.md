Analyzing, Interpreting and Presenting Microbiome-Resistome Data
================================================================

Welcome all to the **Analyzing, Interpreting and Presenting Microbiome-Resistome Data** workshop!

We are delighted to engage in meaningful teachings and discussions in 16S and metagenomic research.

The Microbial Ecology Group (MEG) workshop lessons are designed to introduce researchers to several important areas of metagenomic research to assess microbiome and resistome data. Participants will learn foundational concepts of metagenomic sequencing, datasets, and research challenges. They will gain practical hands-on bioinformatics skills to execute post-sequencing tools and software on a high-performance linux computing system. Furthermore, they will learn to use the R programming language for statistical analysis of metagenomic output files. As always, we would love to get your feedback and input on how we can continually improve the workshop experience!
