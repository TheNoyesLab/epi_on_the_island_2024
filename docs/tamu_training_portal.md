To begin the hands-on portion of the workshop we will load up the TAMU training portal. Paste this web address into your web browser:

```bash

If you are in need of support from our instructors, we will navigate to the `My Interactive Sessions` tab. Once on this page we will right click on the `View only (Share-able link)`.

This will pull up a new Interactive Desktop tab (as seen in the image below). You will then copy the URL from your web browser and paste this into the MEG Slack group or Zoom chat and an instructor now will be able to have a live view your Interactive Desktop and be able to help you troubleshoot any problems going on!

When you are ready to logout of the portal, click the `Log Out` tab (top right of your browser). Once loaded, you will then see a message on how to completely log out of the training portal.
